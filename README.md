# PimaDiabetes-Model

### This was the assignment for the Statistics and Machine Learning - 1 module of Semester-1. The pdf attached named 'assignment-instructions.pdf' contains the detailed instructions of the task provided to us and what we were supposed to do.

### The coursework involved PimaDiabetes.csv, derived originally collected by USA's National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. 
### The task was to do EDA, report issues, unique features, modification of the dataset by addition of columns for specific quesitons like "Has the women had 7 or more pregnancies?" and then fitting a regression model to predict whether a woman will develop diabetes using the column produced.

### The 1000-word report is "Report.pdf". There are 2 csv files, "PimaDiabetes.csv" which contains the data which we are working with and "ToPredict.csv", which is for testing the fitted regression model.

### The jupyter notebook "pima-diabetes-coursework.ipynb" contains the whole codebase of the assignment and can be explored for the work that has been done.
